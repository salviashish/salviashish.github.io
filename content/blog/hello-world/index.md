As customary, every developer is supposed to write their "Hello World" version of code for the language of their choice. So, here it is the hello world version of my first blog post. 

Hi, I am Ashish, predominantly a full-stack .net developer but now engaging myself in the world of frontend and cloud engineering as well. 

About 12 years ago, I started working as Jr. Developer on Web & Sharepoint applications and since then fell in love with the web technologies. Back then, I was a rookie to the concept of blogging and used to learn and write so that I could hardwire my learnings outside of my project work and also help someone through the medium of my blog.  

> They say that the best way to learn is to teach. 

So here it is as I restart to blog again. You can find some of my old posts on [salviashish.wordpress.com](https://salviashish.wordpress.com/).
