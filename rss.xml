So, here it is the hello world version of my first blog post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi, I am Ashish, predominantly a full-stack .net developer but now engaging myself in the world of frontend and cloud engineering as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 12 years ago, I started working as Jr. Developer on Web &amp;#x26; Sharepoint applications and since then fell in love with the web technologies. Back then, I was a rookie to the concept of blogging and used to learn and write so that I could hardwire my learnings outside of my project work and also help someone through the medium of my blog.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They say that the best way to learn is to teach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here it is as I restart to blog again. You can find some of my old posts on &lt;a href=&quot;https://salviashish.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;salviashish.wordpress.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
